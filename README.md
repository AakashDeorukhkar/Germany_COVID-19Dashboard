# Germany_COVID-19Dashboard
A Tableau Visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in Germany as of November 2021

Hello everyone!

The above visualization is a COVID-19 Dashboard with information about the total Cases | Deaths | Recoveries from Germany. 

Along with this, I have also created another dashboard that gives information about COVID-19 vaccinations in Germany.

The source data used for this Dashboard has been collected from : https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/covid19-tracking-germany

This data has further been cleaned and processed using Python.

Cases info: date_grouped.csv

Vaccination info: Cleaned_vaccines.csv

Dashboards are created using Tableau:
